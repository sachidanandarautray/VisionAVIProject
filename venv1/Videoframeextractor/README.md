**Video Frame Extractor**
**This Python script is a utility for extracting frames from videos at a specified frame rate (frames per second). It can process multiple video files within a folder and save the extracted frames to a specified output directory.**

## Features
. Extracts frames from videos at a configurable frame rate (e.g., 1 frame per second).
## Supports multiple video formats, including .mp4, .avi, .mkv, and .mov.
. Automatically skips non-video files in the input folder.
. Saves extracted frames as .jpg images with meaningful filenames.
. Automatically creates the output directory if it does not exist.

## How It Works
#### Initialization: The VideoFrameExtractor class is initialized with the input folder (containing videos)
#### the output folder (where extracted frames will be saved), and the desired frames per second (fps) for extraction.
#### Frame Extraction: The script processes each video in the input folder , calculates the interval based on the videoâ€™s frame rate and the desired fps, and extracts the corresponding frames.
#### Output: Extracted frames are saved in the output folder with filenames that indicate the source video and frame number.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
A valid video file in the supported formats.

### Supported Video Formats
##### .mp4
##### .avi
##### .mkv
##### .mov
Notes
Ensure that the input folder contains valid video files.
Modify the fps parameter as needed to extract more or fewer frames per second.
